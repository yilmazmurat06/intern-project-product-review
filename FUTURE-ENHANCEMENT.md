# Future Enhancements

## AI-Powered Product Recommendation System

### Overview
An AI model will be integrated to analyze comprehensive product data across categories, including:
- Technical specifications and features
- User reviews and sentiment analysis
- Product ratings
- Pricing information

### Core Functionality
When a user provides their specific requirements and budget constraints, the AI model will generate a curated list of products that match their criteria. The system will compare products within the same category to identify the best options based on the user's input.

### Operational Modes

The recommendation system will support two distinct operational modes:

#### 1. User-Friendly Mode (Neutral Recommendation)
- **Objective**: Prioritize the user's best interests
- **Behavior**: The model provides unbiased recommendations based purely on matching the user's needs, budget, and value-for-money considerations
- **Outcome**: Users receive genuine product suggestions that best satisfy their requirements

#### 2. Manufacturer-Friendly Mode (Sponsored Recommendation)
- **Objective**: Promote specific manufacturer's products
- **Behavior**: The model acts as a sales representative for the designated manufacturer, prioritizing their products in recommendations
- **Outcome**: Users receive biased recommendations favoring the manufacturer's products, even when alternative products might better suit their needs or budget
- **Note**: This mode introduces commercial bias and may not serve the user's optimal interests. This feature can enable more competitive marketplace for the manufacturer. If they buy this feature from the software company, their sales can rise and earn more. If it gets implemented succesfully, it can be a great source of income for both the software company and the manufacturer of the products.

### Tiered Sponsorship System

To balance business revenue with user trust, the platform will offer three distinct sponsorship tiers for manufacturers:

#### Tier 1: Visibility Boost (Light Sponsorship)
- **Pricing**: $500-$2,000/month or 2% per conversion
- **Benefit**: Products get preferential placement with "Featured" badge only when they match user criteria (70%+ relevance)
- **Impact**: Minimal bias - sponsored products move up in rankings but don't override merit
- **Quality Requirements**: Minimum 3.5★ rating, accurate specifications

#### Tier 2: Full Sponsored Mode (Aggressive Marketing)
- **Pricing**: $5,000-$20,000/month or 6% per conversion
- **Benefit**: Top placement regardless of fit, AI actively promotes manufacturer's products
- **Impact**: Significant bias - may not reflect optimal user choice
- **Disclosure**: Mandatory "SPONSORED" badge with clear warnings
- **Limitations**: Capped at maximum 30% of displayed results

#### Tier 3: Ethical Featured (Premium Positioning)
- **Pricing**: $2,000-$5,000/month or 4% per conversion
- **Benefit**: "Editor's Choice" badge, enhanced visual presentation, premium listing space
- **Impact**: Zero algorithmic bias - ranking remains merit-based, only presentation is enhanced
- **Quality Requirements**: Strict standards (4.0★ minimum, verified specs, strong warranty)
- **Philosophy**: Similar to premium newspaper advertising - visibility without compromising editorial integrity

#### Revenue Model Options
- **Flat Subscription**: Predictable monthly fee
- **Performance-Based**: Pay only for actual conversions
- **Hybrid**: Low base fee + conversion commission
- **Auction-Based**: Dynamic pricing based on competitive bidding

#### User Protection Mechanisms
- Toggle to disable sponsored recommendations
- "Compare without sponsorship" view
- Transparency dashboard showing sponsored vs. organic results
- Premium subscription option ($5-10/month) for guaranteed unbiased recommendations

### Implementation Considerations
- Clear disclosure should be provided to users regarding which operational mode is active
- Ethical guidelines should govern the use of manufacturer-friendly mode
- Transparency in sponsored recommendations is essential for maintaining user trust
